# DeepSeek V4.1 Flash benchmarks

AMD Strix Halo `gfx1151`, 128 GB unified memory. ISTA-DASLab GSQ-RCO
backbones: `IQ1_M` resident (first table of each section) and `IQ2_XXS` with
streamed routed experts (second table, after the rule); Unsloth `UD-IQ1_M`
(third table) and `UD-IQ2_XXS` (fourth table) with streamed routed experts,
sharing the ISTA Engram file;
`IQ4_NL` Engram tables read from disk, Lucebox Q2_K/Q4_K DSpark drafter. Gufo only: no other
engine runs DeepSeek V4.1 Flash on this machine, so the tables carry no
reference columns. HTTP through `gufo serve`, greedy, thinking off. The
`IQ1_M` and `UD-IQ2_XXS` single-user tables, their multi-user AR tables and
the `UD-IQ2_XXS` multi-user DSpark table were measured November 10, 2026 on
the production `nix build` of the extension at `255e1739` with Gufo
`0e2de43e`. The other tables come from the DeepSeek fork: October 31 on
`0eb9e89c`, and the loading and `UD-IQ2_XXS` memory tables November 2-3 on
`26c7598f`. Tuned profile
`accelerator-performance`, GPU DPM level `auto`, Tctl 37–58 °C at the start of
each run. Prefill rates
are the server's own prompt timings for real chat text; see
[native prefill](#native-prefill) for `gufo bench`.

**Streamed `IQ2_XXS`, `UD-IQ1_M` and `UD-IQ2_XXS`.** The 128.75 GiB, 130 GiB and 154 GiB models keep their dense weights
resident and reads routed experts from a Samsung 990 PRO (PCIe 4.0 NVMe)
into an expert cache that fills the free memory (`--stream-experts`,
defaults). Its speed depends on the disk: a slower SSD costs time on every
expert-cache miss, and misses are most frequent in a new server's first
requests. Each depth sweep and concurrency level starts a
new server, so these rows include that warm-up; a server that has served
similar text decodes faster.

## Single user, DSpark

pp is the highest measured rate per depth across mixed/repetitive text. The
mixed workload asks for a summary and a story (a story at 64K); the
repetitive one copies a passage, introduced as random filler for a
transcription test (otherwise `UD-IQ1_M` comments on the passage and stops),
which prompt lookup verifies up to 15 tokens at a time. Greedy output is identical to plain decoding.

Every session is prepared from a C1 prompt checkpoint before timed decoding;
throughput sums individual request decode rates. Concurrent sessions decode
in one forward; every output matches its isolated C1 reference.

## Multiple users, DSpark

Same pp2048 mixed/repetitive prompts as single-user d0, tg128, context 4096
per user. Concurrent sessions verify their blocks jointly in batches of up to
16 rows; every output matches its isolated AR reference.

**Resident `IQ1_M` with DSpark is not supported in this table on the current
build.** Its weights and the 4.59 GiB drafter leave about 2.2–2.6 GB of device
heap, below the 4 GiB that Gufo's prompt cache keeps free, so the cache holds no
checkpoints. Every session would have to be prepared from a C1 checkpoint, so
the table cannot run. The `IQ1_M` rows below were measured on the fork, which
kept a 1 GiB reserve. Streamed builds still prepare their sessions, though the
same gate holds their cache at the 2.2 GB it commits at startup.

## Prompt lookup

Repeating a 3,000-character C++ file with one function renamed (greedy, 900
tokens, think off): 67.6 tok/s with 16-row verification against 58.5 with the
previous 7-row limit; 62 verifications instead of 131, every copy accepted,
identical output ([E15](EXPERIMENTS.md)). Without a drafter, lookup alone
verifies copies the same way.

## Native prefill

`gufo bench` (synthetic token IDs, one 2048-row pass per pp2048) on the
October 29 `cd8b92c1` build: pp2048 1,394 ± 37 tok/s at depth 0 (three runs; 1,205 on the
October 26 build, [E16 record](artifacts/2026-10-26-prefill-batch/summary.txt)). Served chat prefill is lower for two measured
reasons: real text costs 5–7% more than the synthetic IDs in matched
batches, and the prompt cache's stable-boundary checkpoint adds a 3-token
pass (about 65 ms) to every chat request ([backlog](BACKLOG.md)). A profile
of served requests shows no other host idle time.

Prefill runs the decoder layers (20–39) over each prompt's last 140 tokens
only (decoder SWA bounded replay, [QUALITY.md](QUALITY.md));
`--exact-prefill` runs every decoder row at about half the prefill speed.
`--prefill-batch 4096` gains 2–3% natively but leaves the prompt cache no
memory in the default resident setup (E16), so 2048 stays the default.

## Vision encoder

`ds41_vision_probe` (gpu-test build, third of three encodes), ViT and aligner
of one image; the span then prefills like text.

| DS4.1 Flash vision<br>Image | Patches | Tokens | Encode (ms) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| corn.jpeg | 1,551 | 189 | 83 |
| carrots.jpeg | 3,774 | 444 | 236 |
| 4000 × 3000 (token cap) | 8,748 | 1,001 | 746 |

`gufo serve`: carrots (456 prompt tokens) prefilled in 1.6 s including the
encode, then decoded at 23.6 tok/s; the capped image (1,011 prompt tokens)
answered in 4.1 s. The sidecar adds 0.90 GiB of device memory.

## Loading time

C1, capacity 262144, DSpark. Page cache dropped before the start, to HTTP
readiness; the weights upload from the files directly. Streamed builds
upload their dense weights and preload the built-in ranking of frequently
routed experts before they are ready.

## Memory occupation

Capacity 262144 tokens, AR. Device total minus free, which on this unified
memory APU tracks system-wide use (3.01 GiB idle before the server starts);
it includes the prompt cache's retained checkpoints. Streamed `IQ2_XXS`,
`UD-IQ1_M` and `UD-IQ2_XXS` fill the memory their sessions leave, minus
2 GiB, with the expert cache, so their rows show the cache's size, not a
requirement (the `IQ2_XXS` and `UD-IQ1_M` rows predate this sizing and left
4 GiB).

and restored in 2.9 ms with the same reply; short turns capture in
0.9–4.2 ms and restore in 0.8 ms.
