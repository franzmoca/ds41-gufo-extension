# AGENTS.md

This repository is a Gufo source extension: the DeepSeek V4.1 Flash engine
(provider `deepseek41`), its kernels, tools and documentation.
[UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md) describes the source layout. The production target is
Linux x86-64 AMD Strix Halo (`gfx1151`).

## Build

```sh
nix build                    # Gufo with this extension: ./result/bin/gufo
nix flake update gufo        # move the pinned upstream Gufo (flake.lock)
```

The flake builds tracked files only; stage new files before `nix build`. Measure
performance with `result/bin/gufo` from `nix build`, and keep `flake.lock` the
same in both arms of a comparison.

Tests and development builds run from a Gufo checkout at the pinned revision,
with this repository as an extension directory:

```sh
cd /path/to/gufo
nix develop -c cmake --preset gpu-test -B build/ds41 \
  -DGUFO_EXTENSIONS='*' -DGUFO_EXTENSION_DIRS=/path/to/ds41-gufo-extension
nix develop -c cmake --build build/ds41 --target deepseek41flash_tests
cd build/ds41 && nix develop /path/to/gufo -c ctest -R '^deepseek41flash\.' --output-on-failure
```

`deepseek41flash_tests` builds every test binary, so `ctest` never runs a stale
one. Run the test covering the change (`-R '^deepseek41flash\.expert_store$'`).
The `cpu` tests need no GPU; the `hip` tests need `gfx1151` but no model.

## Extension API

Code includes Gufo only through `<gufo/ext/...>`. `extension.json` declares the
minimum API version. When the extension needs something the API lacks, change
upstream Gufo first: one small PR with its `ext-api` change record under
`include/gufo/ext/changes/`, described on Gufo's own terms (no extension
results). Raise `api_version` once it merges.

## Formatting

`.clang-format` applies to new and changed C++ lines. Most of `runtime/` and
`kernels/rocm/` predates it: never run `clang-format -i` or a format fix over
those directories, since it rewrites unrelated code. Check the files you touched
with `clang-format --dry-run` and compare the warning count against the base
revision; wrap long lines by hand.

## Functional checks

Gufo's text API suites (`tests/functional/` in a Gufo checkout) run against
`gufo serve` of this build. Select suites explicitly: `conversation`, `tools`,
`long-context`, `cache`, `image-inputs`, `tool-images` and `reasoning-budget`
cover this provider ([docs/VALIDATION.md](docs/VALIDATION.md)). Include
`long-context` and `cache` for continuation or prompt-cache changes, and
`tests/functional/pi_agent.py` for coding-agent loops. A missing-model skip is
not a pass.

## Measuring

- Measure what users run: streamed `UD-IQ2_XXS` with the `MXFP8` Engram,
  DSpark and vision, unless the change targets another build.
- Check the host first: `tuned-adm active` is `accelerator-performance` and the
  fans are under PWM control. Never pin GPU clocks.
- Start a fresh server per arm: the expert cache, prompt cache and DSpark policy
  depend on request history, and the expert cache size on the memory free at
  startup (log it).
- Alternate the order of the arms (ABBA). A second run is ~3% slower and the
  first run after idle up to 25% faster. Build nothing during timing runs.
- An output-preserving change must give identical replies and draft counts in
  every arm; check that before reading timings.
- For agent workloads, record one session with `tools/ds41/agent_replay.py`
  and replay it against each arm, so every arm sees the same requests.
- Expert-streaming rules can be compared offline first: `DS41_EXPERT_TRACE=PATH`
  writes a routing trace for `tools/ds41/{prefetch,evict,replay}_sim.py`
  ([tools/README.md](tools/README.md)).
- Keep small measured gains. Report noisy results as inconclusive rather than
  repeating until a run agrees.

## Profiling and kernels

Apply [.agents/skills/optimize-kernel/SKILL.md](.agents/skills/optimize-kernel/SKILL.md),
and [.agents/skills/benchmark-model/SKILL.md](.agents/skills/benchmark-model/SKILL.md)
to refresh the benchmark card. `tools/bench/` holds standalone benchmarks of this
extension's kernels (`nix develop github:gufo-org/gufo -c tools/bench/build.sh <name>`).
Gufo's `tools/prof/prof.py`, `tools/prof/isa_mix.py` and
`tools/bench/gfx1151_peak.hip` run from a Gufo checkout. Successful optimizations
become the default, with no switch to restore the old path.

## Documentation

Model documentation lives in [docs/models/deepseek-v4.1-flash/](docs/models/deepseek-v4.1-flash/):

- `EXPERIMENTS.md`: one `E<n>` section per experiment, retained or rejected,
  plus its index row. Retained JSON, patches and recordings go under
  `artifacts/<date>-<topic>/`.
- `BACKLOG.md`: open work, ranked; move finished items to its done table.
- `BENCHMARKS.md` and `QUALITY.md`: the current card and its evidence.
- `DECODE.md`, `PREFILL.md`, `STREAMING.md`: design and analysis; update them
  when the behavior they describe changes.

Committed artifacts contain no usernames, host names or private paths; scrub
recordings before adding them.

## Development

- Follow Conventional Commits with a single-line message, scope `deepseek41`.
- Add each user-facing change to the `Unreleased` section of
  [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), linking its experiment.
- PR descriptions, the changelog and the README state changes and results, not
  how the work was done.
- Use `gh` for GitHub operations after checking `gh auth status`.
